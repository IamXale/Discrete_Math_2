    "Consider the following experiment:\n",

    "1. The experiment consists of $n$ identical trials.\n",
    "2. The outcome of each trial falls into one of $k$ classes or cells.\n",
    "3. The probability that the outcome of a single trial falls into cell $i$, is $p_i,i = 1,2,...,k$ and remains the same from trial to trial. Notice that $p_1+p_2+p_3+···+p_k =1.$\n",
    "4. The trials are independent.\n",
    "5. The random variables of interest are $Y_1 , Y_2 , . . . , Y_k$, where $Y_i$ equals the number of trials for which the outcome falls into cell $i$. Notice that $Y_1 +Y_2 +Y_3 +···+Y_k =n$.\n",
    "6. The joint probability distribution $P(y) = \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_n!} P_1^{y_1} P_2^{y_2} P_3^{y_3}....P_n^{y_n}$\n",

    "To prove that the expected value $E[y] = \\sum y \\cdot P(y) = n \\cdot p_i$, we will calculate $E[y]$ using the given joint probability distribution.\n",

    "First, let's express $E[y]$ using the formula for expected value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[y] = \\sum_{y} y \\cdot P(y)$$\n",

    "Where $y$ represents the vector of random variables $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_k$ such that $y = (y_1, y_2, ..., y_k)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, substitute the given joint probability distribution into the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[y] = \\sum_{y} \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_n!} P_1^{y_1} P_2^{y_2} P_3^{y_3}....P_n^{y_n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + ... + y_k = n$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[y] = \\sum_{y} \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_n!} (y_1 \\cdot P_1)(y_2 \\cdot P_2)...(y_k \\cdot P_k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the summation is over all possible combinations of $y_1, y_2, ..., y_k$ that satisfy $y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + ... + y_k = n$, each term in the summation represents a specific outcome of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, observe that for each specific outcome, the product $(y_1 \\cdot P_1)(y_2 \\cdot P_2)...(y_k \\cdot P_k)$ can be rearranged as $n \\cdot p_1$ if the outcome corresponds to cell $i$ (where $i$ varies from 1 to $k$), because the $y_i$ and $P_i$ terms are independent of each other and $y_i$ equals the number of trials for which the outcome falls into cell $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the expected value $E[y]$ can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[y] = \\sum_{y} \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_n!} (n \\cdot p_1) + \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_n!} (n \\cdot p_2) + ... + \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_n!} (n \\cdot p_k)$$\n",
